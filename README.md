# Cardiovascular-Risk-Prediction

This project aims to predict the 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) using the Cardiovascular Risk Prediction dataset. The dataset contains information on 3,390 individuals with 16 predictor variables and 1 target variable. The variables represent potential demographic, behavioral, and medical risk factors.

# Problem Statement
The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patients’ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes. Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioural, and medical risk factors. Attributes includes various factors based on the mentioned three categories like sex, age, diabetes, TenYearCHD, is_smoking, etc. For this project, we have used various analysing techniques which includes Data acquisition, Data Description, Missing values imputation, Graphical Representation, Modelling, etc.

# Project Summary
The goal of this project was to use machine learning techniques to predict the 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients using data from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The dataset provided information on over 4,000 patients and included 15 attributes, each representing a potential risk factor for CHD. These attributes included demographic, behavioral, and medical risk factors.

To prepare the data for analysis, extensive preprocessing was performed to clean and transform the data. This included handling missing values using median, mode, and KNN imputation techniques, as well as identifying and removing outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. Skewed continuous variables were also transformed using log and square root transformations to reduce skewness and improve model performance.

Feature selection was performed using variance inflation factor to remove multicollinearity and a new feature called pulse pressure was created to capture the relationship between systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Redundant columns were also removed to simplify the dataset. The most important features for predicting CHD risk were identified as ‘age’, ‘sex’, ‘education’, ‘cigs_per_day’, ‘bp_meds’, ‘prevalent_stroke’, ‘prevalent_hyp’, ‘diabetes’, ‘total_cholesterol’, ‘bmi’, ‘heart_rate’, ‘glucose’, and ‘pulse_pressure’.

To handle the imbalanced nature of the dataset, the SMOTE combined with Tomek links undersampling technique was used to balance the class distribution and improve model performance. The data was also scaled using standard scalar method to ensure that all features were on the same scale.
