# Cardiovascular-Risk-Prediction

This project aims to predict the 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) using the Cardiovascular Risk Prediction dataset. The dataset contains information on 3,390 individuals with 16 predictor variables and 1 target variable. The variables represent potential demographic, behavioral, and medical risk factors.

# Problem Statement
The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes. Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioural, and medical risk factors. Attributes includes various factors based on the mentioned three categories like sex, age, diabetes, TenYearCHD, is_smoking, etc. For this project, we have used various analysing techniques which includes Data acquisition, Data Description, Missing values imputation, Graphical Representation, Modelling, etc.
