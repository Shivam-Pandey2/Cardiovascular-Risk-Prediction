# Cardiovascular-Risk-Prediction


Cardiovascular Risk Prediction dataset provides the patients' information. The dataset contains information on 3,390 individuals with 16 predictor variables and 1 target variable. Each variable (attribute) is a potential risk factor. There are demographic, behavioral, and medical risk factors. We were tasked to predict the 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD).

Overall, while building a machine learning model on Cardiovascular risk prediction data, we applied combination of data processing, machine learning techniques, and model evaluation skills. It was a challenging task and we faced some failures as well but with the right approach and knowledge, we successfully created a model that can accurately predict a patient that can be infected with CHD in future.
